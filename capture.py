"""Reusable Pi Camera capture API.

The camera starts automatically when this module is imported and is kept
open, so take_photo() / capture_jpeg() are ready immediately:

    from capture import take_photo, close_camera   # camera starts here
    try:
        while True:
            frame = take_photo()      # BGR numpy array, ready for YOLO
            ...
    finally:
        close_camera()

To serve photos over the LAN, run server.py (which uses this module).
